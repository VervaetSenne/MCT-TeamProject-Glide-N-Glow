# MCT TeamProject Glide 'N' Glow

## The Team:

- Backend Developers: Warre, Massimo <br>
- Frontend Developer: Remco <br>
- IoT Developer: Senne


## Project Goal:

Glide 'N' Glow is a project that indicates the exact speed you should be moving (to break a specified record). In essence its a strip of light surrounding an entire ice rink. Similar to those you can find in running tracks.

Besides racing there will also be games you can play with these lights and the accompanying buttons.

We will also allow for a more user friendly and customisable setup thanks to the app.

## Our Solution:

An LED-strip around the ice rink with buttons every now and then with some mini-games.
