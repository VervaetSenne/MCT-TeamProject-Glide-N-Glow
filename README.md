# MCT TeamProject Glide 'N' Glow

## The Team:

- Backend Developers: Warre, Massimo <br>
- Frontend Developer: Remco <br>
- IoT Developer: Senne


## Project Goal:

Glide 'N' Glow is a project that indicatees the exact speed you should be moving (to break a specified record). In essence its a strip of light surrounding an entire ice rink. Similar to those you can find in running tracks.

Besides racing there will also be games you can play with these lights and the accompanying buttons.

We will also allow for a more user friendly and customisable setup thanks to the app.At the Memorial Van Damme, a moving light signal around the track indicates the exact speed at which runners should be moving (to break a specific record, for example). Your task is to develop a similar light signal around an ice rink. Similar to the running example, this signal can indicate different speeds for speed skaters. However, the light signal could also be used to create fun games (for example, a light in a specific color that lights up and you have to skate quickly towards it, ...).

## Our Solution:

An LED-strip around the ice rink with buttons every now and then with some mini-games.
